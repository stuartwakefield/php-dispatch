  PHP Relational Mapper
  
  Some sort of data access layer. Not really for ORM but more structured recordsets.
  Although could add repository logic, the only problem is repositories are needed
  in the model and queries / structured recordsets in the view layer. For now will
  just work on getting and structuring data from auto joining tables or views. How
  transformation is added in I'm not quite sure at the moment, may not be that 
  expensive to just loop through the resulting structure and apply transformations to
  get a new structure.
