  Phinject is a Dependency Injection framework for PHP. 

  Phinject simplifies the task of passing objects to other objects within 
  your application. It can  be used to package up constructor logic for 
  quickly prototyping applications and allowing a high level configuration
  without the need for creating dedicated confuration parsing or object / 
  applictation factory classes.
  
  See ./example for usage.
